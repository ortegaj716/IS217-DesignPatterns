	<h1>State + Factory</h1>
	
	<h2>What are States and Factories?</h2>
	<p>Factories are responsible for the creation of objects. Some objects are more complex than others, and could have a lot of setting 
		up to do before proper use. They may have plenty of variables that need to be set or may need other objects to be instantiated inside 
		them and set up as well. Factories take care of complicated object creation and return the fully configured instance.</p>
		
	<p>States determine how certain functions and objects behave. The logic behind certain portions of an object may change depending on the state. For example, 
		a traffic light will light up its red light when its state is STOP and light up its green light when its state is GO.</p>
	
	<h2>How do These Patterns Work Together?</h2>
	<p>This program contains a factory that creates objects depending on what state it's set to. If you needed to only create a certain type of object, 
		instead of creating a whole bunch of if statements, you could simply just make a state to keep track of what objects should be made.</p>
