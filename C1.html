	<h1>Factory + Decorator</h1>
	
	<h2>What are Factories and Decorators?</h2>
	<p>Factories are responsible for the creation of objects. Some objects are more complex than others, and could have a lot of setting 
		up to do before proper use. They may have plenty of variables that need to be set or may need other objects to be instantiated inside 
		them and set up as well. Factories take care of complicated object creation and return the fully configured instance.</p>

	<p>Decorators are functions that get added to existing classes dynamically. They provide a quick and easy way to add additional functionality 
		to an object. Functions that are added dynamically are usually not required for the class to run properly, or else they would have been 
		implemented in the class itself.</p>
	
	<h2>How do These Patterns Work Together?</h2>
	<p>Factories can simplify the creation of complex objects. If you use a factory to specify what kind of object needs to be created or what 
		attributes it should have, the creation of that object becomes easier for the programmer. Some objects may need special functionality; this 
		is where the decorator comes in. In this example, the factory creates players, but adds additional skills (by the use of decorators) 
		depending on what role the player has.</p>
