	<h1>Decorator + Iterator</h1>
	
	<h2>What are Decorators and Iterators?</h2>
	<p>Decorators are functions that get added to existing classes dynamically. They provide a quick and easy way to add additional functionality 
		to an object. Functions that are added dynamically are usually not required for the class to run properly, or else they would have been 
		implemented in the class itself.</p>
	
	<p>Iterators travel through collections of objects and can access their properties. Javascript does not contain a for each loop, but the creation 
		of an iterator can provide that functionality.</p>
	
	<h2>How do These Patterns Work Together?</h2>
	<p>This script iterates through a collection of robot objects and decorates them with weapon functions. If for some reason in your application you 
		need lots of objects to have new functionality, using an iterator and a decorator could get the job done.</p>
