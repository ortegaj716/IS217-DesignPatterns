	<h1>Singleton + Iterator</h1>
	
	<h2>What are Singletons and Iterators?</h2>
	<p>Singletons are objects that are only instantiated once. They may contain objects and functions that you would not want multiple objects to have, such as 
		database connection objects for example. Singletons are used more like tools rather than classes. It is also worthy of note that when using a singleton, 
		you may delay their initialization if desired.</p>
		
	<p>Iterators travel through collections of objects and can access their properties. Javascript does not contain a for each loop, but the creation 
		of an iterator can provide that functionality.</p>
	
	<h2>How do These Patterns Work Together?</h2>
	<p>In this case, the iterator IS the singleton. Only one instance of the iterator is allowed to be created. There is no point in having multiple 
		iterators instantiated, as only one is needed to handle most jobs. This example simply creates an array of fruits and uses the iterator to 
		print them all. The iterator is passed into 2 different variables to determine if the same instance will be passed into both variables.</p>
