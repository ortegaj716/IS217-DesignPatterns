		<h1>What is a Design Pattern?</h1>
		<p>
			While coding applications, there may be times where an objective can be completed efficiently with the use of a strategy.
			These strategies could vary from specific ways to create classes and functions, how to control object behavior, and how 
			various objects should communicate with each other. The "strategies" I am talking about are called design patterns: reusable 
			coding patterns that are solutions to common problems experienced in software programming. Design patterns could be implemented 
			in mostly all, if not all, languages, present a common vocabulary for programmers to discuss certain techniques, and demonstrate 
			how to write more efficient code.
