	<h1>Memento + Facade</h1>
	
	<h2>What are Mementos and Facades?</h2>
	<p>If you know about transactions in InnoDB type databases, then mementos should be familiar territory. Mementos are containers for data sets. Whenever you 
		need to save an object's attributes, you would put them in a memento, and then put the memento in an array. As you keep making mementos, you would 
		start to accumulate a history for that object. If for some reason you need to rollback to a previous state, you could restore your object's data set
		to that of a previous memento in the array.</p>
	
	<p>Facades are function that provide easy high level access to very complicated objects. They obscure the inner workings to present a very easy and 
		workable interface to programmers (Somewhat similar to the factory design pattern; it hides the complicated object creation by presenting an easy
		 interface).</p>
	
	<h2>How do These Patterns Work Together?</h2>
	<p>This example presents mementos that hold 5 cards. Whenever you set your hand to something else, the memento gets saved before it is changed. 
		The program presents a facade by demonstrating an easier way to work with the mementos by saving them automatically when changing your hand.</p>
